Settings for Hybrid MILP (for Fully Connected DNN, and for CNNs): TO for $\alpha,\beta$-Crown
and number of opens nodes in different layers. 20 threads in parallel vs GPU vs 16 threads.

\subsection*{Comparison with PRIMA}

PRIMA \cite{prima} is a major verifier in the ERAN toolkit. In Table \ref{table9}, we report the comparison between PRIMA and $\alpha,\beta$-Crown, mainly from \cite{crown}. The setting is mainly similar from ours, but numbers are not perfectly comparable as the images tested are not  exactly the same (1000 first or 200 first images for CNN-B-Adv), vs 100 first in Tables \ref{table_hybrid}, \ref{table_beta}. Also, time-out settings and hardware are slightly different. The overall picture is anyway the same.

\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{||l||c|c||c||}
		\hline \hline
		Network & $\alpha,\beta$-Crown & Refined $\beta$-Crown & PRIMA \\ 		  
		\hline
		MNIST $5 \times 100$ & N/A  & 14.3\% (102s) & 33.2\% (159s)\\ \hline
		MNIST $5 \times 200$ & N/A & 13.7\% (86s) & 21.1\% (224s) \\ \hline
		MNIST $8 \times 100$ & N/A  & 20.0\% (103s) & 39.2\% (301s)   \\ \hline
		MNIST $8 \times 200$ & N/A & 17.6\% (95s) & 28.7\% (395s)  \\ \hline
		MNIST $6 \times 500$ & 51\% (16s) & $-$ & 64\% (117s) \\ \hline
		CIFAR CNN-B-adv & 18.5\% (32s) & $-$ & 27\% (344s)\\ \hline \hline
		CIFAR ResNet & 0\% (2s) & $-$ & 0\% (2s) \\ \hline \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Undecided images ($\%$, {\em lower is better}), as computed by $\alpha,\beta$-Crown, Refined $\beta$-Crown, and PRIMA, as reported in \cite{crown}, except for $6 \times 500$ that we run ourselves. N/A means that \cite{crown} did not report the numbers, while $-$ means that Refined $\beta$-Crown cannot be run on these DNNs.}
	\label{table9}
	%\begin{tablenotes}
	%	\footnotesize
%		\item Most data is directly from \cite{crown}. N/A means no data either in \cite{crown} or by our running.
%		\item  $^*$ The data in this row is from our own running on first 100 images of the MNIST dataset.
%		\item  $^{**}$ The data is from \cite{crown} on first 200 images of the CIFAR10 dataset.
%	\end{tablenotes}
	\end{table}

Analysis: On the 4 smallest MNIST networks, PRIMA uses a refined path comparable with the Refined $\beta$-Crown. However, it is slower and less accurate than Refined $\beta$-Crown.
On larger {\em hard} networks, PRIMA has also more undecided images than $\alpha,\beta$-Crown, while the runtime is $>5$ times larger.

Notice that kPoly \cite{kpoly}, OptC2V \cite{optC2V}, SDP-FO \cite{SDPFI} numbers were also reported in \cite{crown} on these networks, with even more unfavorable results.

\subsection*{Comparison with MN-BaB}

MN-BaB \cite{ferrari2022complete} is an improvement built over PRIMA, using a similar Branch and Bound technique as used in $\alpha,\beta$-Crown. Results in \cite{ferrari2022complete}
are close to those of $\alpha,\beta$-Crown. However, none of the {\em hard} networks from \cite{crown} that we consider have been tested. We thus tested three representative {\em hard} DNNs (first 100 images) to understand how MN-BaB fairs on such hard instances, and report the numbers in Table \ref{table10}. Results are directly comparable with Table \ref{table_hybrid}.


\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{||l||c|c||c|c||}
		\hline \hline
		 & $\alpha,\beta$-Crown & $\alpha,\beta$-Crown & MN-BaB & MN-BaB \\ 
		 Network & TO=30s & TO=2000s &  TO=30s & TO=2000s \\ 
		\hline
		MNIST $5 \times 100$ & 55\% (19s) & 50\%(1026s) & 60\% (19s) & 50\% (1027s) \\ \hline
		MNIST $6 \times 500$ & 51\% (16s) & 50\% (1002s) & 58\% (18s) & 55\% (1036s) \\ \hline
		CIFAR CNN-B-adv & 22\% (8.7s) & 20\% (373s) & 43\% (14s) & 24\% (576s) \\ \hline 
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Undecided images ($\%$, {\em lower is better}), as computed by $\alpha,\beta$-Crown, and MN-BaB}
	\label{table10}
\end{table}

Analysis: results reveal that MN-BaB is slightly slower and slightly less accurate than $\alpha,\beta$-Crown. Notice the specially high number of undecided images for CNN-B-Adv with TO=30s, probably meaning that 30s is too small for MN-BaB on this large DNN.

	\subsection*{Comparison with NNenum}

NNenum \cite{nnenum} is a complete verifier with good performance according to VNNcomp.
It was the only complete verifier tested in Table \ref{table_complete} to verify more images than $\alpha,\beta$-Crown. The experiments section in \cite{nnenum} does not report
the {\em hard} DNNs we are considering. We tried to experiment it on the same MNIST 
$6 \times 500$ and CIFAR CNN-B-adv as we did in Table \ref{table10} for MN-BaB. Unfortunately, on $6 \times 500$, buffer overflow were reported.
On CIFAR CNN-B-adv, NNenum could not interpret the onnx file we provided.
