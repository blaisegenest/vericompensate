Settings for Hybrid MILP (for Fully Connected DNN, and for CNNs): TO for $\alpha,\beta$-Crown
and number of opens nodes in different layers.


PRIMA is one of ERAN's major verifier. We put a table to compare $\alpha,\beta$-Crown and PRIMA by data from literature. 

\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\caption{Undecided images ($\%$, {\em lower is better}), as computed by $\alpha,\beta$-Crown (pure BaB or refined) and PRIMA. }
	\begin{tabular}{||l||c|c||c||}
		\hline \hline
		Network & $\alpha,\beta$-Crown & Refined $\beta$-Crown & PRIMA \\ 		  
		\hline
		MNIST 5$\times$100 & N/A  & 14.3\% (102s) & 33.2\% (159s)\\ \hline
		MNIST 5$\times$200 & N/A & 13.7\% (86s) & 21.1\% (224s) \\ \hline
		MNIST 8$\times$100 & N/A  & 20.0\% (103s) & 39.2\% (301s)   \\ \hline
		MNIST 8$\times$200 & N/A & 17.6\% (95s) & 28.7\% (395s)  \\ \hline
		MNIST 6$\times$500 $^*$ & 51\% (16s) & N/A & 59.5\% (116s) \\ \hline
		CIFAR CNN-B-adv $^{**}$& 18.5\% (32s) & N/A & 27\% (344s)\\ \hline \hline
		CIFAR ResNet & 0\% (2s) & N/A & 0\% (2s) \\ \hline \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\begin{tablenotes}
		\footnotesize
		\item Most data is directly from \cite{crown}. N/A means no data either in \cite{crown} or by our running.
		\item  $^*$ The data in this row is from our own running on first 100 images of the MNIST dataset.
		\item  $^{**}$ The data is from \cite{crown} on first 200 images of the CIFAR10 dataset.
	\end{tablenotes}
	\end{table}
As shown in above table, PRIMA is usually less accurate and slower than $\alpha,\beta$-Crown on above networks.


MN-BaB's is a verifier with performance close to $\alpha,\beta$-Crown on several benchmarks. However, the experiments section in their paper does not include network we focus on. So we run MN-BaB on those networks on our device. The comparison is as follows:


\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
		\caption{Undecided images ($\%$, {\em lower is better}), as computed by $\alpha,\beta$-Crown, and MN-BaB}
	\begin{tabular}{||l||c|c||c|c||}
		\hline \hline
		 & $\alpha,\beta$-Crown & $\alpha,\beta$-Crown & MN-BAB & MN-BAB \\ 
		 Network & TO=30s & TO=2000s &  TO=30s & TO=2000s \\ 
		\hline
		MNIST 5$\times$100 & 51\% (18.4s) & 48.5\%(954s) &  & \\ \hline
		MNIST 6$\times$500 & 51\% (16s) & 50\% (1002s) & 52\% (18s) & 52\% (1036s) \\ \hline
		CIFAR CNN-B-adv & 22\% (8.7s) & 20\% (373s) &  & 41\% (621.7s) \\ \hline 
	\end{tabular}
	\end{table}



NNenum is another new verifier with good performance. However, the experiments section in NNenum's paper does not include network we focus on. So we run NNenum on those networks on our device.
