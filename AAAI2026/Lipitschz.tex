		\iffalse
		Most DNNs are brittle to small perturbations. Extensive works have thus been performed to verify robustness for DNNs.
		However, these works mostly consider local robustness, i.e. in the neighborhood of an image.
		While local robustness is useful to have an idea how often non robust images happen, by repeating the verification on 1000 or 10000 pre-obtained images, the main shortcoming is that we have no guarantee that a specific new incoming image, e.g. in a video feed, is robust: The verification process takes too long and requires too much resources to be performed online on embedded systems.
		
		In this paper, we consider {\em global} robustness, that is, guarantees not restricted to a set of local images. For that, we consider {\em bounds} on the switch of values between the different decision classes of a DNN due to a given perturbation. 
		The verification question is much harder than local robustness, as the number of complex variables doubles (from the deviation image to the image and its deviation).
		Further, the values each neuron can take is no more in a small neighborhood.
		Therefore, the global verification process is very complex.
		To obtain useable bounds, we develop several novel partial MILP models for global robustness, with different trade-offs. Last, we use order reduction techniques to reduce the space of images considered, avoiding unrealistic inputs, by using linear PCA. 
		This results into usable bounds, allowing in real time to certify robustness for $87\%$ of incoming images in the MNIST benchmark for a L1-perturbation of $0.5$, as well as for a surrogate computing the hidden plastic strain associated to a deformation map of a pipe.

	\subsection{Using Two Identical Models}
	The most straightforward way is to use two identical MILP models, i.e., to build a model $\mathcal{M}^{large}$ based on two identical MILP models $\mathcal{M},\mathcal{M}'$ with completely disjoint variables (and their own constraints) plus some extra constraints:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Add constraints for connecting input nodes $\mathcal{M},\mathcal{M}'$ to meet the requirement $|\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{y}| \leq \varepsilon$.
		\item Set the optimization objective as the difference between two variables of the same output node in two models $\mathcal{M},\mathcal{M}'$ (because we want to compute $\max|f(\boldsymbol{x}) -f(\boldsymbol{y}) |$).
	\end{enumerate}
	This large model contains twice as many binary variables as $\mathcal{M}$. The computational cost of solving an MILP model grows roughly exponentially with the number of binary variables, and hence it will cost much more time.
	
	We may relax some constraints (by changing binary variables to continuous variables) as in the case of local robustness. However, the problem is that even relaxing a few nodes can cause a significant loss of accuracy, which motivates us to explore other modeling approaches.
	
	\subsection{A Simplified model}
	
	To avoid above problem, we introduce a simplified model that is to use one variable $y_i$ to represent the difference of each two variables: that is, if $x_i$ and $x'_i$ are two variables in $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{M}'$ representing the same node, then we set $y_i=x_i-x'_i$ and and $\hat{y}_i=\hat{x}_i-\hat{x}_i'$. The relation between $y_i$, $x'_i$ and $\hat{y}_i$ is $\hat{y}_i = \ReLU(x'_i+y_i)-\ReLU(x'_i).$ 
	
	Given  $\gamma_i$ be the upper bound of $y_i$, the constraints for $\hat{y}_i$ are the follows:\begin{align*}
		\hat{y}_i &\leq a \gamma_i               &\quad \hat{y}_i &\geq y_i - a \gamma_i \\
		\hat{y}_i &\geq (a-1) \gamma_i           &\quad \hat{y}_i &\leq y_i + (1-a) \gamma_i
	\end{align*} where $a$ is a binary variable.
	
	
	The following plot illustrates the constraints described above.
	
	\begin{figure}[b!]

\caption{The possible values of $\val(\hat{y}_i)=\ReLU(\val(x_i))-\ReLU(\val(x'_i))$ depending on $\val(y_i) = \val(x_i)-\val(x'_i)$.}
	\label{fig.1v}
\end{figure}


	
	Based on above constraints, we can sketch this simplified model:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item For each input node, each output node, and each pre-activation and post-activation node in the hidden layers,  set one variable $y_i$. 
		\item Set constraints for input nodes.
		\item Set linear constraints . In this case, since the meaning of $y_i$ is $x_i-x'_i$, this constraints will not use the bias.
		\item Between pre- and post- activation nodes, set the MILP constraint described above.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	The key point is that, although this model sets 3 variables (and their binary variables) for each node in the network, only $y_i$  contributes to the final results, and we can ignore $x_i,x_i'$ (and their binary variables) during the optimization.
	
	As a result, we can relax the binary variables used to $\hat{x}_i = \ReLU(x_i)$ and $\hat{x}'_i = \ReLU(x'_i)$.
	
	Now the simplified model contains the same number of binary variables as the MILP model for local robustness. Hence this model runs much faster compared to the previous one. The trade-off is lower accuracy compared to the first model under unlimited time. In practice, with a reasonable timeout, this simplified model can usually obtain a better bound.
	
	One major disadvantage of this model is that the solution obtained through optimization may not be valid-i.e., the output computed by the network on the optimized inputs may not equal the output value in the solution. Nevertheless, it is meaningful to compute the upper bound. 
	
	%	However, in practice, with a reasonable timeout, this simplified model can usually obtain a better bound.
	%	
	\subsection{Improving the Accuracy of the Simplified Model}
	We can remove the disadvantage and improve the accuracy of the above simplified model by modifying the constraints, at the cost of increased computational time — a trade-off between accuracy and speed.

		%	\end{align*} 
	%	
	%	
	%	Moreover, we can add two more natural constraints: $x_i'+y_i \geq \alpha_i \hspace*{1ex}\wedge\hspace*{1ex}  x_i'+y_i \leq \beta_i.$

\end{figure}
	
Given $\gamma_i$ as the upper bound of $y_i$, $\alpha_i,\beta_i$ be the upper and lower bound of $x_i,x_i'$, 
	the precise  constraints for $\hat{y}_i = \ReLU(x'_i+y_i)-\ReLU(x'_i)$ (along with $\hat{x}'_i=\ReLU(x'_i)$) are as follows:
	\begin{align*}
		& \begin{aligned}
			y_i + x'_i &\leq a\beta_i        &
			y_i &+ x'_i \geq (1-a)\alpha_i \\
			x'_i       &\leq a'\beta_i       & 
			x'_i       &\geq (1-a')\alpha_i \\
			\hat{y}_i  &\leq a\gamma_i       &
			\hat{y}_i  &\geq -a'\gamma_i \\
			\hat{y}_i  &\leq y_i + (1-a)\gamma_i  &
			\hat{y}_i  &\geq y_i - (1-a')\gamma_i \\
			\hat{y}_i  &\leq -x'_i + a\beta_i &
			\hat{y}_i  &\geq -x'_i + (1-a')\alpha_i \\
			\hat{y}_i  &\leq y_i + x'_i + (1-a)(-\alpha_i) &
			\hat{y}_i  &\geq y_i + x'_i + a'(-\beta_i)
		\end{aligned}
	\end{align*} Here, $a,a'$ are binary variables, and $a'$ is also the binary variable in the constraints for $\hat{x}'_i=\ReLU(x'_i)$. 
	

Similar to the second model, the constraints on $x_i$ for $\hat{x}_i=\ReLU(x_i)$ are not necessary, or at least can be relaxed without any loss in accuracy.
	
	%	\begin{align*}
		%		& y_i+x'_i \leq a\beta_i \quad\wedge \quad y_i+x'_i\geq (1-a)\alpha_i\\	
		%		& x_i' \leq a'\beta_i \quad\wedge \quad x_i'\geq (1-a')\alpha_i\\
		%		&\hat{y}_i \leq a\gamma_i \quad\wedge \quad	\hat{y}_i \geq -a'\gamma_i \\
		%		&	\hat{y}_i \leq y_i+(1-a)\gamma_i \quad\wedge \quad	\hat{y}_i \geq y_i - (1-a')\gamma_i \\
		%		&	\hat{y}_i \leq -x'_i+a\beta_i \quad\wedge \quad	\hat{y}_i \geq -x'_i+(1-a')\alpha_i \\
		%		&	\hat{y}_i \leq y_i+x'_i+(1-a)(-\alpha_i)\quad\wedge \quad	\hat{y}_i \geq y_i+x'_i+a'(-\beta_i) \\
		%	\end{align*} 
	
	The following plot illustrates the constraints described above.
	

	In practice, when we relax the constraints for a node, we will convert $a_i$ and $a_i'$ to continuous variables together. In principle, we can also choose to change  only one of those two binary variables.
	
	%	The relaxation of this model is similar: let $a$s and $a'$s be continuous variables instead of binary/integer variables. Unlike the first model in this section, relaxing a few nodes does not lose too much accuracy.
	
	A special relaxation approach of this model is to treat the binary variables $a'$ appearing in the above constraints and the binary variables for $\hat{x}'_i=\ReLU(x'_i)$ as distinct variables, and relax only the latter. 
	
	This approach has a similar disadvantage as the model in the previous section: the output computed by the network on the optimized inputs may not equal the output value in the solution. Similarly, it is meaningful to compute the upper bound using this approach. 
	
	
	


	\section{Experimental Evaluation}
	
	We implemented our code in Python 3.8.
	Gurobi 9.52 was used for solving LP and MILP problems. We conducted our evaluation on an AMD Threadripper 7970X  ($32$ cores$@4.0$GHz) with 256 GB of main memory and 2 NVIDIA RTX 4090. 
	
	We will do experiments on two networks for MNIST dataset and another physical model. Two MNIST have the same structure. They are full-connected DNN with 5, 10 outputs and 784 inputs; each hidden layer has 100 neurons. One of them is a normally trained neural network and another is for trained for adversarial robustness. We call them MNIST $5\times100$-Normal and MNIST $5\times 100$-DiffAI. As the name shows MNIST $5\times 100$-DiffAI has a better robustness. The physical network is a simplified model with 10 input neurons, 26 output neurons, and 2 hidden layers with 50 neurons each.
	
	\subsection{Experiment results for robustness (MNIST)}

\end{table}

On the full space, we reach bounds of $8.2$ (on $\beta^{.5}_{0,1}$), which is too pessimistic as it allows to certify 0 image robust. The worst-case found by the "2v" $485 \times 2$ binary variables after 130000s only displays a difference of 
$0.37$, $20 \times$ away from the bound found.

\end{figure*}	




\paragraph{Reduced space}

We now consider a PCA model order reduction to avoid considering improbable images, 
speed up obtaining the bounds, and obtain less pessimistic bounds.
We settle on 20 orders, as the MNIST DNN considered run on a images obtained from projecting to the reduced order and projected back to the full dimension 
display the same accuracy of $97$\% as the DNN on the original images, meaning no accuracy is lost from reducing to 20 dimensions, which is the only thing which matters. On such a reduced space, bounds obtained are much more precise, and one can certify robustness of images online.

	The network of Pipe system is relatively simple and in the tests, we will open all $\ReLU$ nodes.

	

	We will compare the results of different modeling methods.
